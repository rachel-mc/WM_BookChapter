Here, we present the computational details of __Chapter 14__ (McInerney et al., 2025).    
The `lme4`, `glmmTMB`, and `gamlss` R packages were used to fit candidate Generalised Linear Mixed Models.      
Model adequacy was determined by Half Normal Plots using `hnp` and Worm Plots using `gamlss`.   
Model selection was performed using Information Criteria and Likelihood Ratio Tests.
