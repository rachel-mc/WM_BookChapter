# Wildlife Management: Integrating Conservation and Innovation in Human-Altered Landscapes

Here, we present the computational details of Chapter 14 (McInerney et al., 2025).    
The ‘lme4’, ‘glmmTMB’, and ‘gamlss’ R packages were used to fit candidate Generalised Linear Mixed Models.      
Model adequacy was determined by Half Normal Plots using 'hnp' and Worm Plots using 'gamlss'.   
Model selection was performed using Information Criteria and Likelihood Ratio Tests.
